# Overview

If you prefer using a graphical user interface, follow [GUI installation guide](./install_gui). For the command line version (CLI), we offer multiple ways to install the CLI app. Each of the options has pros and cons. Choose the one that suits you best.

1. Using a pre-compiled binary. The quickest and the most straightforward installation route for the CLI version.
2. Using the Rust package manager, [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/). If you already using Rust, this installation route is the best option.
3. Compiling it from the source in the Github repository. It gives you the most up to date version, but the resulting binary may not be fully tested.
4. Installing from the development branch. We keep new features in the development branch until we finish testing them. This installation method will allow you to test new features before they are released. However, the development branch may be unstable.
