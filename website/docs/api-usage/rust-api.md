## Using SEGUL API in Rust

The SEGUL API is available as a Rust crate. The crate is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/segul) and can be included in your project by adding the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
segul = "0.*"
```

Or use cargo to add the dependency:

```bash
cd my-project

cargo add segul
```
