## Using SEGUL API in Python

We recommend to use the Python package [`PyO3`](https://pyo3.rs/) to interact with SEGUL API. The package documentation provides a comprehensive guide on how to use `PyO3` to interact with Rust. Add `segul` as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
segul = "0.*"
```

Find out more about available SEGUL functions and how to use them in the [SEGUL API documentation](https://docs.rs/segul/latest/segul/index.html).
