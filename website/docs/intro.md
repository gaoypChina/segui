# Welcome

**Thank you for using SEGUL!** 🙏🏻

`segul` is an ultrafast and memory efficient phylogenomic data manipulation and summary statistics calculation.

## Big changes in the version 0.19.0 💪🏼

- New command structure. Check [quick start](https://docs.page/hhandika/segul-docs/quick_start#cli-command-list) instruction to see the most up to date commands. We are working on updating the documentation throughout the website.
- New command to calculate summary statistics for raw reads and contigs.
- Input dir `-d` or `--dir` now can infer input format based on the file extension. No need to specify the input format anymore.
