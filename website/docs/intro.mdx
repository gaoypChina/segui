# Introduction

**Thank you for using SEGUL!** üôèüèª

We develop **SEGUL (SEquence and Genomic UtiLities)** to address the need for a high-performance and accessible phylogenomic tool. It is particularly well-suited for large-scale phylogenomic projects, especially those involving thousands of loci and hundreds of samples. Additionally, SEGUL is capable of handling small Sanger sequences effectively. SEGUL is a practical solution to typical phylogenomic data analyses and a proof of concept for genomic software that scales from smartphones, tablets, and personal computers to high-performance computing clusters. Check out [Chan 2024 perspective](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1755-0998.13993) for an independent review of SEGUL.

## Navigating the Documentation

[Below](#quick-start-%EF%B8%8F), we provide a quick start with an overview of using SEGUL. The quick start assumes familiarity with phylogenomic data and some experience using related tools. Detailed instructions on installing SEGUL are available in the [installation guidelines](/docs/installation/overview). The documentation is structured by version (i.e., GUI, CLI, or API) organized in a section. Within a section, we provide detailed instructions on how to use each feature. In general, feature guidelines are independent of each other. You should be able to jump to a feature you need for the version of SEGUL you use without checking out another section. We recommend checking the [GUI general usage](/docs/gui-usage/general) section if you use the GUI app. To use the CLI application, we recommend starting with the [CLI Overview](/docs/cli-usage/overview) section. These sections provide an overview of the app, input and output formats, datatype, and other general information about the app. Please refer to the [support](/docs/support) section for questions, issues, or feedback about the app and its documentation. We also welcome collaboration and contribution.

### CLI vs GUI vs API

For general users, the choice will be between the command-line (CLI) and graphical interface (GUI) applications. If you answer yes to any of the following questions, you should use the CLI version of the app. Otherwise, either GUI or CLI will help you. 

1. Are you planning to run the app in a non-GUI environment like an [HPC](https://www.ibm.com/topics/hpc) cluster?
2. Do you run SEGUL as part of a pipeline?
3. Do you need the utmost efficiency?

You can also install both versions and use them interchangeably. They operate in their environment and do not interfere with the other. You can take advantage of the strength of either one of them, depending on workflow scenarios. Learn more about the differences between the CLI and GUI versions [here](./cli_gui.md).

For developers, SEGUL is available as a Rust crate, which you can easily integrate into Rust code. The Python library is available as a Python binding to the SEGUL API called PySEGUL. It does not require Rust knowledge to use it. The Rust crate also works with R. However, using it in R requires some Rust knowledge.

Learn more about using SEGUL API [here](/docs/category/api-usages).

:::tip
If you write a pipeline in Python, we recommend using PySEGUL. It is available in the Python Package Index (PyPI), which will simplify dependency management.

### Installation

We recommend downloading GUI apps from your operating system's [official store](/docs/installation/install_gui). It is a one-click installation. The fastest installation route for CLI is using the pre-compiled binaries. If you are familiar with installing single executable CLI apps, download the latest release using the links below. The [installation guide](/docs/installation/install_binary) provides more detailed instructions.

#### Example Dataset

We provide sample datasets to help you get started or test the app if you find any issues using your datasets. The datasets include small alignments in SEGUL-supported formats. Due to the large file sizes, we cannot provide genomic datasets. You can download the genomic data from public repositories, such as [NCBI SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra).

### GUI Usage

1. Open the app.
2. Use the navigation bar to select the feature you want to use. For example, to concatenate alignments, click the "Alignments" button.
3. Use the dropdown menu to select the task. For alignment concatenation, select "Concatenate alignments."
4. Click the "Add file" button to add the input files. You can also input a directory on desktop platforms by clicking the "Add directory" button. The app will look for files matching the directory.
5. The input tab bar displays all the input files. You can remove a file by clicking the "Remove" button. Removing a file will only remove it from the input list, not the file system.
6. Click the "Add output directory" button to add the output directory. On mobile platforms, this directory will be the app's default directory.
7. You also need to add the parameters for some tasks. For example, you must add the filtering parameters to filter alignments.
8. Click the "Run" button to start the task.
9. Once done, the app will display the output in the output tab bar. You can also tab the file to open it in the app file viewer. The current version only supports plain text and comma-separated (CSV) data.
10. You can also share the output. There are two share options. The quick share will create a zip file containing the output and share it using the system share sheet. You can also share individual files by clicking the share button on the output viewer.

:::warning
The mobile version of the GUI has limited capabilities in handling many files. Find out more in the [guideline for mobile users](/docs/gui-usage/general#specific-guideline-for-mobile-users).
:::

### CLI Usage

The `segul` command is structured as follows:

```bash
segul <command> <subcommand> --option1 value1 --option2 value2
```

For example, to concatenate alignments:

```bash
segul align concat --dir alignments/ --output aln-concat
```

Some arguments are required, while others are optional. For example, the `--output` option is optional. The app will use the default output directory if you do not provide it. The command below will concatenate all the alignments in the `alignments/` directory and save the output in the `Align-Concat` directory.

```bash
segul align concat --dir alignments/
```

We recommend using the `segul --help` option to see the available options for each command, the `segul <command> --help` option to see the available options for each subcommand, and the `segul <command> <subcommand> --help` option to see the available options for each subcommand.

For more detailed usage information, please see the [command usage](./cli-usage/command_options.md) section.

:::tip
Since version 0.19.0, you don't need to specify the input format. The app will automatically detect the format based on the file extension. The lower version only allows auto-detect format for non-directory input. If you have non-standard file extensions, use the `--format` option to set the input format regardless of the version.
:::

:::warning
The commands below expect SEGUL version 0.19.0+. If you use a lower version, the subcommand becomes the command, and the dir input option requires a specific input format.

For example:

```bash
segul alignment concat -d <input-directory>
```

In the version lower than 0.19.0, the command above will be:

```bash
segul concat -d <input-directory> -f <input-format>
```

### API Usage

SEGUL API is available as a Rust crate. You can use it to develop your application or integrate it with other programming languages. The API is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/segul).

To add SEGUL API to your project, you can use the `cargo add` command:

```bash
cd my-project

cargo add segul
```

Or add manually in the `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
segul = "0.*"
```

If you want to use SEGUL API in Python, we provide a Python binding called PySEGUL. The library allows you to access SEGUL features like using any Python library. No Rust knowledge is needed. Install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pysegul
```

```python
import pysegul

def concat_alignments():
    input_dir = 'tests/data'
    input_format = 'nexus'
    datatype = 'dna'
    output_format = 'fasta'
    partition_format = 'raxml'
    prefix = 'concatenated'
    output_dir = 'tests/output'
    concat = pysegul.AlignmentConcatenation(
        input_format,
        datatype,
        output_dir,
        output_format,
        partition_format,
        prefix
        )
    concat.from_dir(input_dir)
    # For inputting a list of files instead of a directory
    input_paths = ['tests/data/alignment1.nex', 'tests/data/alignment2.nex']
    concat.from_files(input_paths)
```

Most of the PySEGUL features follow the same code pattern except for features that require specific parameters, such as alignment filtering, sequence extraction, and sequence removal. For these features, use a setter to input files or directories. Then, the matching method parameters are used to run the analyses. For example, to extract sequences using regular expression:

```python
import pysegul

def extract_sequences():
    input_dir = 'tests/align-data'
    input_format = 'nexus'
    datatype = 'dna'
    output_format = 'fasta'
    output_dir = 'tests/output'
    extract = pysegul.SequenceExtraction(
        input_format,
        datatype,
        output_dir,
        output_format,
        )
    extract.input_dir = input_dir
    extract.extract_regex("(?i)^(abce)")
```
