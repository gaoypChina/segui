A GUI version of [segul](https://github.com/hhandika/segul), an ultrafast, memory-efficient application for phylogenomic data manipulation and sequence summary statistics. It carries similar performance to the CLI version of the app with the convenient of GUI, while still retaining reproducibility through logging support. The GUI version will also support iOS, iPadOS and Android, in addition to macOS, Windows, and Linux.

Our first goal is to offer all the SEGUL features in the GUI version. In the future, we will take advantage of the GUI to offer more features that are not possible in the CLI version, such as interactive data visualization.
